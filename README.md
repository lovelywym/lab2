3.Project Name: Constructing passageways between cities


4.Intended language: MATLAB


5.Summary of our project: The project works out a scheme for constructing passageways between given cities according to their sizes and terrain and represent it in a plot.The constructed system of passageways is expected to be relatively efficient.


6.Motivationï¼šWe have played a game before called mini metro that designs metro ways between cities and keep putting trains on it to transport objects from city to city.The whole system is supposed to run well with no objects piling up at any one of the cities if the metro ways are designed in a wise way. We thus decide to work out a simplified version of the game that only includes the road-designing part.


7.Tentative Design of your project (several paragraphs and some figures if you would like)


7.1 Features of your software and its corresponding description


7.2 Data dictionary or datagram demonstrating the structure or the interaction of different building blocks.


8.Expected outcome


Bottom-line: a.This program needs to generate a map containing randomly distributed cities, as well as to randomly specify the terrain (including only waterway and land route) between each two cities.


b.This program needs to take the terrain between different cities into consideration and automatically choose the waterway transportation as the preference choice as long as the terrain appears to be the waterway.


c.After taking in two specified cities from the command line, this program needs to take various routes into consideration and come up with the least time that it takes to travel.


Expected: List of features that you think you can accomplish before the deadline


8.3Potential: List of features that you hope to accomplish before the deadline


It is totally OK to accomplish less than you expected in the real-world software development process. So plan big, but plan wisely


9.Timetable: What do you wish to achieve at each time step before the deadline (A table, a itemized list, or a grant chart is needed for clear demonstration )


10.Extra preparations: We plan to learn to analysis some practical cases of road designing in real life as well as in the virtual game so as to obtain general patterns of road arrangement. For various layouts of cities, we will further learn to find their approximation to more general examples and then deal with them with reference to general methods.


11.Task assignment: Who will accomplish which part, we expect every group member has the equal workload.
