## b) Binary search is a search algorithm for a particular element in an ordered array.The search process starts with the middle element of the array, and ends if the middle element happens to be the element to look for.

## If a particular element is greater than or less than the middle element, look in the half of the array that is greater than or less than the middle element, and compare from the middle element as you did at the beginning.

## If the array is empty at a certain step, it cannot be found.The search algorithm cuts the search area in half with each comparison
